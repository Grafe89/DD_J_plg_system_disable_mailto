[![GPL Licence](https://badges.frapsoft.com/os/gpl/gpl.png?v=102)](https://opensource.org/licenses/GPL-2.0/)  

This plugin disables also the "recommend to a friend link" and the "recommend to a friend form" from frontend.            <br>
                                                                                                                          <br>
By default, Joomla! has no option to disables these, because it comes from locked com_mailto component.                   <br>
It´s possible to disable mailto function for each article, but not globally by simply disabling com_mailto.               <br>

Here that Disable MailTo Plugin helps. It allows the activation and deactivation of the component by plugin settins.      <br>
By default, com_mailto will be disabled. Just need to install Disable MailTo, it´s all, simple and effective.             <br>

**All features through plugin settings:**
- Redirect SEO old component mailto links to homepage or to custom URL
- Remove link to friend link from fontend article settings dropdown
- And the described switch to enable/disable com_mailto

Note: This plugin is like a switch to fire enable/disable com_mailto just on plugin save. So, it´s not realy a system plugin feature, it´s a way beetween to optimize page load performance and bring that feature.<br>
**Plugin must be enabled to trigger enable/disable events. To undo changes, just need to uninstall plugin.**              <br>
